basic structure of a clean architecture project:
3 layers:
    - Data:
        - Model (www, things that come from the outside)
        - Repositories (bridge to Repositories in Business layer)
        - Datasource (db)

    - Business:
        - Entities (things that are on the phone in contrast to Model in Data layer)
        - Repositories 
        - Usecases (gets triggered by action on widgets e.g. clicking on a button; 'get the data of something')

    - Presentation:
        - Pages (use all the widgets eg. Button)
        - Providers (gets data from Datasource and refreshes the widgets)
        - Widget
